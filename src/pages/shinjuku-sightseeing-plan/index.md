Recently, I read lonely planet Tokyo. There are many good information and introduced famous sightseeing spot. It's a really useful book. But I had a question about restaurants. Because I've never been there despite being a local people. Also, I was walking downtown, foreigners asked me about the way. They wanted to go some restaurant, but I didn't know there.
 I think tourist go to restaurants for tourist, also expensive. So in this article, I gonna introduce about "Cheap" tourism plan around Shinjuku by local. It's good for backpacker or students. 


## About Shinjuku station

[Shinjuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku)
is a big city in Tokyo. Shinjuku station is busiest station in the world. There are many sightseeing spots and restaurants. When meeting friend, I often
go to restaurants in Shinjuku. There isn't for only tourist, also for local.

## Tips
### 1. Go to Shinjuku from evening
In the afternoon, you should go to other city. Shinjuku is downtown, so at night is better. Billboard　is beautiful at night, you can go around enough even from night.

### 1. Use chain stores and eat a lot
You can eat so much Japanese food in chain restaurants. Local often go to chain restaurant and cheap. In Shinjuku, there are many chain restaurants.

### 2. Don't eat a lot in Japanese pubs
In Japanese pubs, it calls 'Izakaya' in Japanese, you should just drink. Don't have to eat a lot. Because there are many good restaurants for eating. Also food in Japanese pubs is expensive. 

### 3. Go to public bath, don't have to go to hot spring
If you have a time permitting, I strong recommend to go to public bath, it calls 'Sento' in Japanese. Because you'll feel japanese local style.


## Plan
### 1. Having a meal at Yoshinoya or Ootoya or Omoide-yokocho.
### 2. Waking in Kabuki-cho 
### 2. Drinking at Hanbee or Medaka
### 4. 【Time permitting】Going to public bath at Kosugi-yu in Koenji
